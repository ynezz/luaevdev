# luaevdev

Small library for comfortable access to Linux input subsystem(evdev particularly) from Lua.

## About

I've created this small library, because I somehow needed to process(and sometimes also modify) output of
barcode reader, which was connected to the system as USB/HID keyboard.

So according to this use case my aim wasn't to create fullblown library from day one, but instead
I've added everything necessary for my needs, particularly handling just of the key events. Anyway
I think, that it's generic enough to add support for other event types, so as always, patches are welcome :)

## Build instructions

1. `$ git://github.com/ynezz/luaevdev.git`
1. `$ cd luavdev`
1. `$ mkdir build && cd build`
1. `$ cmake ..` or `cmake-gui ..`
1. `$ cmake --build .`
1. `$ sudo cmake --build . --target install`

## Usage

`$ cat test.lua`

``` lua
require("evdev")

function pretty_white(s)
  return s:gsub('\r', '\\r'):gsub('\n', '\\n'):gsub('\t', '\\t')
end

function log(...) io.stdout:write(string.format(...), '\n') end

function read_test(device, debug)
	local p, e, r

	local p, e  = evdev.new()
	if e then log("evdev create error: %s", e) return end

	p:set_log_function(log)
	p:set_debug(debug)
	r, e = p:open(device)
	if e then log("open() barcode reader error: %s", e) return end

	repeat
		log("Please scan a barcode...")
		r, e = p:read_keys_until('KEY_ENTER')
		log("Read barcode: %s", pretty_white(r or 'nothing'))
	until e

	log("Barcode read error: %s", e)
	p:close()
end

read_test({ vendor=0x76d, product=0x1 })  -- Toyota Denso GT-10 (barcode reader)
```
